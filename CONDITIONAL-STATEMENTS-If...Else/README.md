### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

**If...Else Statements**

In the previous exercise, we used an if statement that checked a condition to decide whether or not to run a block of code. In many cases, we’ll have code we want to run if our condition evaluates to false.

If we wanted to add some default behavior to the if statement, we can add an else statement to run a block of code when the condition evaluates to false. Take a look at the inclusion of an else statement:
```
if (false) {
  console.log('The code in this block will not run.');
} else {
  console.log('But the code in this block will!');
}

// Prints: But the code in this block will!
```
An else statement must be paired with an if statement, and together they are referred to as an if...else statement.

In the example above, the else statement:

- Uses the else keyword following the code block of an if statement.
- Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces {}.
- The code inside the else statement code block will execute when the if statement’s condition evaluates to false.

if...else [statements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/statements) allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as binary decisions.
